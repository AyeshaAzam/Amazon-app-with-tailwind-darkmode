### everytime we need to compile the tailwind css file to our public folder: 'npm run dev' ( or to to build the css)
### to run the app: use the live server by right click....



### tailwind: https://tailwindcss.com/resources

### with Tailwind , we can control more and make it customisable as i want and all that by adding bunch of css classes ( properties9), than what we can do with boostrap css

### Icons from tailwind : https://heroicons.com/

### Jdenticon : https://jdenticon.com/get-started/vanilla-js.html ( for CDN script) and https://jdenticon.com/ ( website)

### Connecting with firebase:

### We are also connecting with firebase, create project, then go to project setting and copy the CDN script portion and add on the firebase.js file.

### also add the script tag in index.html.

This 3 things we need to add in index.html, to make firebae work:

1. initial firebase app script
2. firebase- analytics script
3. firebase-firestore script

## NOTE: Link the Genereted css file not the custom one in index.html
